## Regular languages

regular expressions are expressions that are build up by regular operations. The value of a regular expression is a language.

If a language is regular, then it is described by a regular expression.

## GNFA

GNFA = Generalized nondeterministic finite automaton.

GNFAs are just NFAs but where the transisions can have regular expressions as labels.

There are some restrictions on a GNFA, look at slide 20, lecture 3

The definition of the GNFA can be seen on slide 21, lecture 3

## Converting a DFA to a Regular expression

See example 1.68 on page 76 in Sipsers book

## Converting a regular expression to a NFA

see example 1.56 and 1.58 in the book page 68 and 69 Sipsers
