A lexer can be decribed by regular expressions

A parser can be described by context-free grammars

A lexer can be implemented by a finite automata, a parser a pushdown automata

Inherently ambiguous languages are context free languages that only can be generated by ambiguous grammars.

Ambiguity is important not to have, because it can fuck up the semantics of a programming language
