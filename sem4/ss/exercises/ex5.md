# Exercise Session 5

## Exercise 1

Looking at the proof at 1.70 page 78 (Sipser) shows that any pumping lemma that is the length of $p$ or longer can be broken into the three pieces $xyz$.

## Exercise 2

See the solution, the rule 1 is mostly used where $y^0$

## Exercise 3

To prove it we need to show that it is reflexive, symmetric and transitive.

It is reflexive because of the definition. It says that $x$ and $y$ are indistinguishable from eachother

It is symmetric becase of the definition.
