# Exercise Session 5

## Exercise 2

a)

$N=\{S,A,B\}$

$\sum = \{a,b\}$

It is ambiguous yes see pictures

b)

$N=\{S,A,B\}$

$\sum = \{a,b\}$

It is not ambigous no because there cannot be made two trees for the same string.

c)

$N=\{S,A,B\}$

$\sum = \{a,b\}$

The gramma is ambiguous yes see pictures

d)

The grammar is useless because it cannot go from S. But it is not ambiguous

## Exercise 3

S      -> Number

Number -> $N_1$ $N_2$ Digs

$N_1$    -> Sign
| $\lambda$

$N_2$    -> Digs period
| $\lambda$

Sign   -> plus
| minus

Digs -> digit $M$

M -> digit
| $\lambda$
